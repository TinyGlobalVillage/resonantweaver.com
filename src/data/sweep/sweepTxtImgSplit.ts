    content: `House and land energies are rarely "just one thing". 
    It's usually a blend of human imprints, spiritual presence, unique land energies, architectural or design influences, and/or environmental factors.

    Energies can linger in a space through absorption, resonance, attachment, or even environmental feeding.

    Signs your space might be out of energetic alignment: 

    • Sudden mood shifts when entering certain rooms.
    • Feeling watched, symbolic dreams or resistance towards changing design or layout of your home.
    • Sporadic activity, like knocking, shadows or cold/warm spots. 
    • Consistent underlying tone, no matter what changes: can feel floaty, grounding, buzzing, or oppressive.

    There's no "one size fits all". Every space has its own story, and a simple clearing might not be the solution. Some spaces need to be "worked with", and others call for subtle adjustments in how you live within them. 

    Each space requires a unique approach. That's what the Harmonic Sweep is designed for. Bringing your home and land back into harmony, in a way that works with their true nature.
