    content: `Resonant Weaver is born from one simple truth: energy is the architecture beneath everything. 
    When it’s in flow, life feels steady, alive, and connected. When it’s tangled or fragmented, we feel the dissonance in our bodies, our relationships, our homes, and our sense of purpose. 
    My work is about listening to that architecture and reflect it back with clarity.

    The tapestry of the woven world is accessible to read. The thread running through it all is resonance. I don’t approach energy as something to fix, but as something to remember. 
    When you see yourself clearly and the mirror is held without distortion, 
    the body and soul know how to realign.

    This path wasn’t something I studied in a straight line. 
    My background is in animation, where I learned how to bring invisible ideas to life. 
    At the same time, I was quietly weaving with subtle energies: sensing, watching, listening, mapping. Over time, those threads braided together, allowing me to bring to life visualisations of what I sense.

    content: `I live in small house in the forest, and it keeps me in connection to nature. The rhythm of the seasons, walking barefoot in thick moss, foraging wild herbs, and listening to the land, the weather and the birds, has taught me that energy is never abstract. 
    It is rooted, physical, and woven into daily life. 
    That is how I work too. Not as an escape from the body, but as decent back into it.

    If this resonates, you’re welcome to explore what I offer, or simply reach out. This work can’t be fully explained, it’s meant to be felt.
