# Through the Prism: A Journey into the Energy Body

Our energy bodies have been overlooked for a long time. The aura has been ridiculed, and those talking about it dismissed. Rupert Sheldrake's work confirms the existence of the "morphogenetic field". Science is now starting to embrace the term "biofield".

There's a Scandinavian expression — *Kjært barn har mange navn*. This directly translates to: “A loved child has many names.” There isn't an exact English equivalent, perhaps “call it what you will.”

  The name doesn't matter; what matters is that this energy field is part of us, and it is our birthright to learn how to understand and navigate it.
  
  Our energy bodies have many layers and many structures—explained through many ancient traditions, and recognized by energy practitioners who can perceive them.

## Chakras — Toroidal Pools

  One of the most well-known structures is the chakra system: energy centers within the body where energy collects and circulates—like small ponds or pools. Each generates a toroidal field with a central axis where energy is circulated and transported. Each chakra also contains vortexes that project energy outwards.

## Meridians — Rivers Between Pools

Next are the meridians. These are rivers or streams of energy, feeding the pools—transporting energy around the body in an intricate network that keeps everything moving.

## Central Column — Axis Mundi

At the core is the central column—our central vertical channel—connecting the earth below and the sky above. Yin and Yang. Feminine and masculine. It is the original frequency—the **axis mundi**. This structure is the first to form in the embryo and often the last to remain intact in times of illness. The strength of the flow within the central column determines the size and vitality of the surrounding toroidal field.

The central column is the carrier of pure universal energy—source stream, cosmic consciousness—**unfiltered potential**. This unfiltered energy is the source of all creation flowing through us.

## Refraction — The Prism

As energy streams into the column, it is refracted by each chakra and interpreted through the lens of your beliefs, gifts, ancestral stories, intentions, and experiences.

Just as a prism bends light, our energy bodies shape the flow of universal energy. Through these centers, it splits into rainbow frequencies, expressing through thought, emotion, action, and presence.

> We don’t just “see the world as it is.”  
> **The world is reflected back to you based on how you perceive it.**  
> Reality is a mirror, shaped by internal energy and beliefs.

Our bodies are prisms, refracting light into a unique experiential expression. If there’s a distortion in the prism—dirt on the lens, a crack, or a chip—our life experience, emotional responses, and worldview become skewed, leading to confusion, disconnection, or imbalance.

The life you live is the rainbow projection. The “movie” of your life is the interplay between pure universal consciousness and the unique geometry that is your energetic structure.

**Healing** is not about seeking the light outside of us, but about clearing the distortions within our own prism.  
**Alignment** occurs when we allow the full spectrum of our true self to shine without obstruction.  
**To awaken** is to realize that you are not separate from the light; you are the prism through which it shines.
